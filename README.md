## Simone Wien, PhD Candidate

I am a PhD candidate in Epidemiology at Emory University seeking policy-focused postdoctoral positions beginning as early as June 2026. Broadly, my research leverages large, population-based administrative datasets, quasi-experimental methods, and social theory to address challenges that arise when evaluating the impact of policy on reproductive and maternal and child health outcomes. 

I'm currently looking for postdoctoral positions beginning as early as June 2026. I am open to relocating and have worked across multiple research areas including maternal and child health, substance use, HIV, health services, and outbreak response.
