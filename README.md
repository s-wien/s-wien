## Simone Wien, PhD Candidate

I am a PhD candidate in Epidemiology at Emory University seeking policy-focused postdoctoral positions beginning as early as June 2026. I am open both to relocating and to working across multiple research areas—my research has spanned maternal and child health, substance use, HIV, health services, and outbreak response.

Broadly, my research leverages large, population-based administrative datasets, quasi-experimental methods, and social theory to address challenges that arise when evaluating the impact of policy on reproductive and maternal and child health outcomes. I am currently a guest researcher with the [New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene](https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/about/about-doh.page), and was previously a fellow at the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/index.html).
